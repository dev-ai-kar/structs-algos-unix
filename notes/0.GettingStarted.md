## 🧰 Environment Setup & IDE Tips

This note documents the setup process for the Princeton Algorithms course.
It uses Linux with IntelliJ IDEA and the `algs4.jar` library.
It also captures key lessons from debugging the first assignment.

## 💡 IntelliJ IDEA: What *Not* to Do

- ❌ **Do not click “New Project”** — this is meant for advanced configurations.
- ✅ Always use **“Open”** and select the **entire project folder**, not individual `.java` files.
- 🧭 Use the provided project zip from [Lift Setup Guide](https://lift.cs.princeton.edu/java/linux/) to ensure correct structure and classpath.

---

## 🧭 What Happened During Setup

1. **Missing Libraries at Compile Time**  
   Attempted to compile `Barnsley.java` using `javac-introcs`, but got import errors for `StdDraw` and `StdRandom`.  
   ➤ Cause: `algs4.jar` was missing from the classpath.

2. **Located `algs4.jar`**  
   Found inside `/usr/local/lift/lib/`, confirming the Lift installer worked.

3. **Patched Compile-Time Script**  
   Edited `/usr/local/bin/javac-introcs` to include `algs4.jar` in the `CLASSPATH`.

4. **Runtime Error: `NoClassDefFoundError`**  
   Compilation succeeded, but running with `java-introcs` failed due to missing runtime classpath.

5. **Patched Runtime Script**  
   Edited `/usr/local/bin/java-introcs` similarly to include `algs4.jar`.

## 📦 Assignment 0: Hello, World

Based on [Assignment Spec](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/hello/specification.php):

- Write `HelloWorld.java` and `HelloGoodbye.java` to test basic compilation and command-line arguments.
- Use `RandomWord.java` to test `StdIn`, `StdOut`, and `StdRandom` from `algs4.jar`.
- Compile using:

  ```bash
  javac-introcs HelloWorld.java
  ```

- Run using:

  ```bash
  java-introcs HelloWorld
  ```

---

## 🔗 Solution: HelloWorld.java

See the solution file in the repository: [`HelloWorld.java`](https://github.com/dev-ai-kar/structs-algos-unix/blob/main/code/HelloWorld.java)

```java
public class HelloWorld {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello, World");
   }
}
```

## 🧪 Verification Checklist

- ✅ Java 11 installed (`java -version`)
- ✅ `algs4.jar` accessible in `/usr/local/lift/lib/`
- ✅ IntelliJ configured with correct SDK and project folder
- ✅ `javac-introcs` and `java-introcs` patched with correct classpath
