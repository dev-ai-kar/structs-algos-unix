## Overview

Union−Find is a data structure that supports dynamic connectivity problems. This implementation explores:

- Quick Find
- Quick Union
- Weighted Quick Union
- Weighted Quick Union with Path Compression

We'll apply these concepts to solve the percolation problem from physical chemistry.

## Analysis of Tree Depth

The maximum depth of any node x is at most lg N (where lg is log base 2)

### Proof

1. When tree T1 containing x merges with T2:
   - The size of tree containing x at least doubles
   - This occurs because x's tree is always the smaller one
2. Depth only increases by 1 when merging with same-size tree

### Depth Growth Pattern

| Tree Size | Maximum Depth |
|-----------|---------------|
| 1         | 0            |
| 2         | 1            |
| 4         | 2            |
| 8         | 3            |
| 16        | 4            |
| 32        | 5            |
| N         | lg(N)        |

## Performance

Weighted Quick Union with Path Compression is linearithmic: O(N + M lg N)

- N = number of objects
- M = number of union-find operations
