## 🌌 What Is This Repository?

A modular, Unix-minded archive inspired by the legendary _Princeton Algorithms Part I_ course.  
From Union-Find galaxies to the black holes of QuickSort, this repo is your personal launchpad for exploring fundamental ideas with creative rigor.

---

## 🪐 What's Inside?

- `code/`: Source code in C++, Python, and Java
- `notes/`: Jekyll-ready markdown notes and lecture reflections
- `docs/`: Syllabus pdfs and structure insights

## 🎯 Why This Matters

> "To master code is to master clarity.  
> To master clarity is to master structure.  
> To master structure is to touch the stars."

Whether you’re preparing for interviews, contributing to Eve’s intelligence, or simply deepening your understanding of computational truths — this is your dojo, your observatory, your playground.

## 🛸 How to Begin

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/structs-algos-unix.git

# Explore lecture notes
cd notes/_posts
```

Add your own module, test an algorithm against real-world inputs, or visualize a tree’s growth from depth-zero. Each lecture is a stepping stone — each data structure, a planet waiting to be mapped.

## 🌠 Build + Publish Pipeline

This repo integrates with [vaibhavdeokar.com](https://github.com/dev-ai-kar/vaibhavdeokar-portfolio) through a custom Netlify build:

- Markdown notes auto-sync into your blog
- Image assets routed for clean Jekyll rendering
- File renaming & metadata injection handled by `netlify-build.sh`

---

## 🧘‍♂️ Study Rituals

- Begin each session with intention 🌱  
- Diagram before you implement 🧠  
- Debug like a detective 🔍  
- End each study with a note-to-self 📝

---

## 🪶 License

MIT — learn freely, teach boldly, attribute thoughtfully.
